Loading DEMs to horizontal grid:
1)You need have DEM tiles ready. On sciclone or james, you can find them under:
# sample: $DEM_dir = '/ches/data10/whuang07/Case1/DEMs/DEM_pre/DEM/';
# sample: $DEM_dir = '/sciclone/data10/whuang07/NWM/DEM/DEM/';

2)you need have a input hgrid.old: the old hgrid.gr3 that the DEMs to be loaded, note that the projection must be lat/lon

3)All DEMs should be linked under the current DEM folder

4) Follow the steps below:
  0 interpolate DEM/etopo1.asc to hgrid.old
  1 cd DEM, run sym*_part1.pl.
  2 cd ../
  3 ln -sf DEM/dem_*.asc .
  4 edit dems.in, the first number is the total number of dem_*.asc
    the second number is the total nodes you want to use.
  5 submit run_james
  6 mv hgrid.new hgrid.old
  7 then repeat step 1 with sym*_part2.pl
  8 repeat steps from 2-5
  9 your hgrid.new will be the final one with all DEMs loaded.
  10 set minimum depth to 5 m in the region of min_5m_ll.reg

  or copy this folder to your dir, e.g.:
      cp -rL . $somedir 
      or
      cp -rL /schism/src/Utility/Pre-Processing/NWM/Load_Bathy_mpi $somedir
  then, run the automation under $somedir:
      ./auto.pl (see comments inside; tested on James and Stampede2)
